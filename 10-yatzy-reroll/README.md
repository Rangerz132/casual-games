### Game Description

Yatzy Reroll is an exciting twist on the classic game of Yahtzee, taking it to new heights with innovative features that offer additional opportunities to score big. Players engage in a strategic battle against both themselves and other opponents, aiming to achieve the highest possible score.

This strategic decision-making adds depth and excitement, allowing players to optimize their scores.
